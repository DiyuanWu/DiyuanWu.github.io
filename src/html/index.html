<p>Hi there! My name is Diyuan Wu (吴迪远 in Chinese), I'm currently a PhD student in <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/home/">Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)</a> starting from fall, 2022 . I'm very fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="http://marcomondelli.com/">Marco Mondelli </a>. Prior to my PhD journey in ISTA, I received a master degree in communication system from <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>, Laussane, Switzerland in 2022, and bachelor degree in information and communication engineering from <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC(电子科大)</a>, Chengdu, China in 2019. </p>
<p>I work in the field of (deep) machine learning theory, which includes two aspects: <em>(1) From practice to theory:</em> given structures and properties of the practical complicated model, we try to theoretically understand them on simpler but tractable models; <em>(2) From theory to practice:</em> we use the theoretical insight to improve practical model's utility and efficiency. I'm particularly interested in settings with <em>high-dimensional</em> data/models. The topics that I'm currently interested in are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understanding the emergence of geometric structure (such as neural collapse, low-rank bias) in feature learning regimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding how attention-based models learn the latent structures in the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Still exploring) Connections between continuous generative models (such as diffusion models) and autoregressive generative models (such as LLMs).</p>
</li>
</ul>
