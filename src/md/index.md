Welcome to my homepage! My name is Diyuan Wu (吴迪远  in Chinese), I'm currently a PhD student in [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) starting from fall, 2022, fortunately working with Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). Prior to my PhD study, I received a master degree in communication system from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Laussane, Switzerland in 2022, and bachelor degree in information and communication engineering from [UESTC(电子科大)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), Chengdu, China in 2019. 


I mainly work on machine learning theory. Specificly, my research works aim to: *(1) theoretical understand of experimental phenomenons and preperties,* and/or *(2) use theoretical insights to improve the utility and efficiency of practical model.* I'm particularly interested in the settings with *high-dimensional* data/models. Currently, I'm mainly working on the following problems currently:

- Understanding of the emergence of structured features (e.g. neural collapse, low rank bias) in different settings, and their impact transfer learning.

- Understanding how attention-based model learn from structured data.
