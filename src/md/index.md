Welcome to my homepage! My name is Diyuan Wu (吴迪远  in Chinese), I'm currently a PhD student in [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) starting from fall, 2022, fortunately working with Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). Prior to my PhD study, I received a master degree in communication system from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Lausanne, Switzerland in 2022, and bachelor degree in information and communication engineering from [UESTC(电子科大)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), Chengdu, China in 2019. Please find my lastest CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PrUZtBdlb-NPoXDNgkdFQtmVU8mCE7cm/view?usp=sharing).


I mainly work on machine learning theory. Specificly, my research works aim to: *(1) theoretically understand experimental phenomenons* and *(2) use theoretical insights to improve practical utility and efficiency.* I'm particularly interested in problems with **high-dimensional** data/models. Currently, I'm mainly working on:

- Feature learning: how neural networks map data to features and learn features from data.

- Weak-to-strong generalization: how strong student model supervised by weak teacher model perform better than teacher.
