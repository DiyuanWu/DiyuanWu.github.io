Hi there! My name is Diyuan Wu (吴迪远 in Chinese), I'm currently a PhD student in [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) starting from fall, 2022 . I'm very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Marco Mondelli ](http://marcomondelli.com/). Prior to my PhD journey in ISTA, I received a master degree in communication system from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Laussane, Switzerland in 2022, and bachelor degree in information and communication engineering from [UESTC(电子科大)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), Chengdu, China in 2019. 

I work in the field of (deep) machine learning theory, which includes two aspects: *(1) From practice to theory:* given structures and properties of the practical complicated model, we try to theoretically understand them on simpler but tractable models; *(2) From theory to practice:* we use the theoretical insight from theory to develop methods that improve practical model's utility. I'm particularly interested in settings with *high-dimensional* data/models. The topics that I'm currently interested in are:  

- Understanding the emergence of geometric structure (such as neural collapse, low-rank bias) in feature learning regimes.

- Understanding how attention-based models learn the latent structures in the data.

- (Still exploring) Connections between continuous generative models (such as diffusion models) and autoregressive generative models (such as LLMs).
